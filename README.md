## Smart heating idea

This application will combine Google Calendar, weatherstack and custom apis, to create pleasing experience, when setting home heating.

Google calendar will be used to suggest turning heating down, to save on energy. The weather api will be used to suggest when to turn the heating on. And the custom api will take care of saving users preference and communications with the hardware of the smart heating.

[weatherstack API Documentation](https://weatherstack.com/documentation) to get weather forecast.

[Google calendar API Documentation](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/js) shows how to use it in application front-end using javascript.
